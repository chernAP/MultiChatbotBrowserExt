## Project Description
Browser extension for Chrome that allows sending the same message to multiple AI chatbots and search engines simultaneously. The extension should support Google Search, ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. When activated, it opens a popup window displaying all open browser tabs, allowing users to select target tabs, input a message, and automatically submit it to all selected services.

## Please remember to update this list after each change
1. Attempt: Initial project setup with basic functionality for Google Search and ChatGPT. Need to implement support for Claude and Gemini, improve tab handling, and add proper error handling.
